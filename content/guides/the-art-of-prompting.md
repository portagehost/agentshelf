# The Art of Prompting: Getting Better Results from AI

Artificial intelligence models, like ChatGPT, rely on user input—called a **prompt**—to generate responses. A well-structured prompt can make the difference between a vague, unhelpful reply and a detailed, useful answer. Understanding how to craft effective prompts will help you get the best results.

## What Is a Prompt?

A prompt is the input you provide to an AI model to guide its response. Think of it as a question or instruction that tells the AI what you want. Since AI models work with tokens (small pieces of words), the way you phrase your prompt affects how the model interprets and processes your request.

## Why Does a Good Prompt Matter?

AI models generate text based on probabilities. A poorly worded prompt can lead to vague, off-topic, or incomplete answers. A well-structured prompt provides the model with clarity, leading to more relevant and high-quality responses.

## Prompting Tips

### 1. Be Specific and Clear

**Instead of:** "Give me some exercise tips"  
**Try:** "What are the benefits of strength training compared to cardio for weight loss?"

A vague prompt gives a broad answer, while a specific prompt focuses the model's response on the exact information you need.

### 2. Provide Context

AI responds best when it understands the scenario. Adding details helps tailor the response.

**Instead of:** "How do I write an email?"  
**Try:** "I need to write a professional email to my manager requesting a few days off next month. How should I phrase it?"

### 3. Specify Your Desired Format

If you need a list, table, or step-by-step guide, tell the AI exactly what you want.

**Instead of:** "Give me marketing ideas for a real estate agent."  
**Try:** "List five creative social media marketing ideas for a real estate agent and lay out a month long content calendar."

### 4. Define the Role of the AI

Sometimes, assigning a role helps generate more authoritative and structured responses.

**Instead of:** "Explain quantum mechanics"  
**Try:** "As a physics professor, explain the basics of quantum mechanics in simple terms for a beginner."

### 5. Use Iteration

If the AI's first response isn't exactly what you need, refine your prompt and try again.

**First Prompt:** "Explain blockchain in real estate."  
**Refined Prompt:** "Explain how blockchain technology can improve security and efficiency in real estate transactions, with examples."

### 6. Limit or Expand the Response

If an answer is too long or short, adjust the prompt accordingly.

**For a shorter response:** "Summarize the Fair Housing Act in one paragraph."  
**For a detailed response:** "Explain the Fair Housing Act and its impact on real estate transactions, including key provisions and case examples."

### 7. Avoid Ambiguous Language

Some words have multiple meanings, which can confuse AI. If needed, clarify your request.

**Instead of:** "What are some tips on client security?"  
**Try:** "What are some tips on safeguarding my client's security from data breaches and online fraud?"

### 8. Ask the Model to Generate the Best Prompt

**_And my favorite prompting technique:_**

If you're unsure how to phrase your request for the best response, tell the model what you want to accomplish and ask it to suggest an optimal prompt.

**Example Prompt:**

```
I'm a real estate agent listing a 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom home in a desirable neighborhood. I want to generate a compelling property description that emphasizes the home's modern kitchen, spacious backyard, and proximity to top-rated schools. What's the best way to phrase my prompt to get the most detailed and engaging listing from an AI?
```

**AI-Suggested Prompt:**

```
Write a persuasive and engaging real estate listing for a 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom home in [neighborhood]. Highlight the modern kitchen with stainless steel appliances, a spacious backyard perfect for entertaining, and the home's proximity to top-rated schools. Use a warm, inviting tone and include a call to action for potential buyers.
```

## Keep in mind...

Good prompting techniques help you get more precise, insightful, and useful AI-generated responses. Don't be afraid to try different prompts or even combining some of these techniques.
