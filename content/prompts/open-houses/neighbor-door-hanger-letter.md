Write a personalized letter to neighbors of a home I have listed, inviting them to the open house and asking for referrals.

Property details:
- Address: [the listing address]
- Brief description: [2-3 key features]
- Open house date/time: [when]

Key messages to include:
- You're representing their neighbor and wanted to introduce yourself
- Invite them to preview the home (see what their neighbor did with similar layout)
- Ask if they know anyone looking to move to this great neighborhood
- Position yourself as "the neighborhood expert"
- Mention recent sales or market activity in the area

Tone: Friendly and neighborly, professional but warm. This is about building relationships, not just selling this house.

Include your contact info and a clear invitation to stop by or reach out.

Format as a personal letter or door hanger. Keep it under 200 words.
