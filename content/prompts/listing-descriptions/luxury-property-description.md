Write an elegant, sophisticated property description for a luxury listing.

Property details:
- Address or exclusive neighborhood: [location]
- Price: [listing price]
- Bedrooms/Bathrooms: [numbers]
- Square footage: [size]
- Luxury features: [list 5-7 high-end features like "chef's kitchen with Sub-Zero appliances," "infinity pool," "smart home automation," "wine cellar," "private gym"]
- Architectural style: [modern, traditional, Mediterranean, etc.]
- Views or setting: [oceanfront, mountain views, private estate, etc.]

Target buyer: [e.g., "executive," "second-home buyer," "empty nester"]

Tone: Sophisticated and aspirational without being pretentious. Use elegant language that evokes emotion and lifestyle. Focus on the experience of living there, not just features. Emphasize privacy, quality, craftsmanship, and exclusivity.

Avoid clichés like "dream home" or "must see." Keep it 200-250 words.
