Write a friendly email to my sphere of influence (past clients, friends, family, professional contacts) to stay top-of-mind without being pushy.

Context to include:
- Recent professional achievement: [e.g., "helped 5 families find homes this month," "earned a designation," "hit a milestone"]
- Brief market insight: [one interesting trend in 1-2 sentences]
- Personal touch: [optional - recent personal update, holiday, season]

Tone: Warm and conversational, like updating a friend. Not salesy. Primary goal is staying connected, secondary goal is reminding them I'm their real estate resource.

End with a soft ask for referrals: if they know anyone thinking about buying or selling, I'd love to help.

Keep it under 200 words.
