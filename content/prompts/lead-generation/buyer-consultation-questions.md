Generate a list of 10-12 strategic questions to ask during an initial buyer consultation that will help me understand their needs and build trust.

Focus areas to cover:
- Current living situation and timeline
- Budget and financing readiness
- Must-haves vs. nice-to-haves
- Lifestyle and daily routine considerations
- Long-term plans (growing family, retirement, etc.)
- Decision-making process (who else is involved?)

Format: Open-ended questions that encourage conversation, not yes/no answers. Include 1-2 questions that show I'm thinking about their life, not just selling houses. Order the questions from easiest/least personal to more in-depth.
