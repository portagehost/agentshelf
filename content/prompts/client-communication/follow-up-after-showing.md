Write a friendly follow-up text message to a client who just toured a property with me.

Details:
- Client name: [name]
- Property address: [address]
- What they liked: [specific features they commented on]
- Any concerns they mentioned: [if applicable]

Tone: Warm and professional, not salesy. Ask if they have questions and if they'd like to see other properties. Keep it under 100 words and conversational, like texting a friend.
