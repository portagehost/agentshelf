Write a tactful script for discussing a price reduction with a seller whose home hasn't sold.

Context:
- Original listing price: [price]
- Days on market: [number]
- Number of showings: [number]
- Feedback from showings: [summarize - "priced too high," "needs updates," "good property but overpriced"]
- Recommended new price: [amount]
- Current market comparables: [mention 2-3 recent sales]

Key points to cover:
- Acknowledge their disappointment and validate their feelings
- Present the data objectively (showings, feedback, market activity)
- Explain that the market determines value, not our opinions
- Show how the new price positions them competitively
- Emphasize that sitting at the wrong price costs them money (carrying costs, market fatigue)
- Frame it as a strategic decision, not a failure

Tone: Empathetic but direct. Confident and consultative. Use "we" language (we're in this together). Balance honesty with encouragement.

Keep it conversational, 250-300 words. Format as talking points, not a rigid script.
