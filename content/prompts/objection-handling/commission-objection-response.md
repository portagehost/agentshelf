Write a confident, professional response to a seller who says "Your commission is too high" or asks me to reduce my rate.

Context to include:
- My commission rate: [your standard rate]
- Services I provide: [list 5-7 key things you do - professional photos, marketing, negotiation, staging advice, etc.]
- Recent success story: [brief mention - "sold 3 homes over asking this month," "average sale price 5% above list"]
- Market reality: [how commission impacts marketing budget and agent motivation]

Tone: Confident but not defensive. Focus on value and results, not justifying the rate. Use the "investment, not expense" framing. Acknowledge their concern but stand firm.

Include a question at the end that refocuses on their goals: [e.g., "What matters most to you - saving $X on commission or netting the highest possible sale price?"]

Keep it conversational, 150-200 words.
