Write a thoughtful response to a buyer who says "We're going to wait until interest rates come down before buying."

Points to address:
- Current rate: [approximate current rate]
- The "marry the house, date the rate" concept (can refinance later)
- What happens if rates drop: [more competition, higher prices]
- Cost of waiting: [home prices typically appreciate X% per year]
- Real numbers example: [show comparison of buying now vs. waiting 6-12 months]

Tone: Educational, not pushy. Use a "let's run the numbers together" approach. Acknowledge their concern is valid but help them see the full picture. Position yourself as their advisor, not someone just trying to make a sale.

Include a question: "Would you like me to show you a comparison of buying now versus waiting 6 months, so you can make an informed decision?"

Keep it 200-250 words, conversational and easy to understand.
