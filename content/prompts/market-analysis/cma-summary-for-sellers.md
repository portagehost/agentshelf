Write a compelling summary to accompany my Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) for a seller.

Property details:
- Address: [property address]
- Key features: [beds/baths/sqft/special features]
- My recommended listing price: [amount]
- Price range analyzed: [low to high]

Market context:
- Recent comparable sales: [mention 2-3 addresses and prices]
- Current market conditions: [hot/balanced/cool]
- Average days on market: [number]
- Competition: [number of similar active listings]

Tone: Confident and data-driven, but not overly technical. Explain WHY this price positions them for success. Address potential seller concerns about pricing. Show that this recommendation will attract buyers while maximizing their return.

Keep it under 250 words. This will be the opening page of my CMA presentation.
